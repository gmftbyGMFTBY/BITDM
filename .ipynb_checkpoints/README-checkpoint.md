本课程作业由两部分组成：平时作业、课程Project(进行Presentation可获得加分，但由于小组较多，不能够保证所有组都进行一次报告，可在Project进行中依当前进度进行报告，不要求一定完成后再进行)。

The assignments of the course consists of two parts: homeworks, course project(Optional of project presentation, you can present while the project is in progress rather than all of the project finished, presentation counts towards the bonus for final grade)
